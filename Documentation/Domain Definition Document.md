# Project domain
The project will focus on creating a knowledge and data resource which will integrate electronic healthcare data from different source datasets (representing different countries of the European Union) while being easy to exploit and expand. This improves the potential of treating any citizen of the EU, decreases medical expenses for both citizens and hospitals, as well as enhances academic research opportunities due to the resource availability. Additionally, the amount of data can be used for creating artificial intelligence systems that can aid in medical decision making.
# Purpose
The aim of the project is to build a knowledge graph concerning heterogeneous healthcare data about patients, professionals, facilities and other entities from European countries with vastly different healthcare systems. This result could be the foundation to create a service which help EU citizens access their medical data with ease, no matter their current location and country of data origin inside the EU. Moreover, healthcare providers, doctors and governments would benefit form a solution of this type by reducing costs, time and increasing the overall health of a population.
